sailfish-en_ios
===============

English virtual keyboard with (mostly) iOS layout for SailfishOS. Includes LEFT &amp; RIGHT arrow keys.

File path starts from the root (/) folder and you need to be in developer mode (i.e. use "devel-su")

NOTE! First make a backup of files InputHandler.qml &amp; Popper.qml renaming them e.g. InputHandler.orig & Popper.orig. No other files need be overwritten.
