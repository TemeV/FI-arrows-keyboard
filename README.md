sailfish-en_ios
===============

English QWERTY virtual keyboard for SailfishOS with a custom SymView layout that, before evolving, started as an iOS layout. Includes LEFT &amp; RIGHT arrow keys (UP &amp; DOWN in SymView) + several other-than-English specific accented &amp; special characters, as well as currency symbols, under different letters (see <a href="https://github.com/tmikkonen/sailfish_en-ios/blob/master/usr/share/maliit/plugins/com/jolla/layouts/en_ios.qml">en_ios.qml</a> for specifics).

File path starts from the device's root (/) directory and you need to be in developer mode (i.e. use "devel-su"). 

Copy *.qml and *.conf files to the equivalent directories on the device.
No need to replace any system files.

After copying, remember to restart the maliit server:
"killall maliit-server"

NOTE! Starting from SailfishOS 1.0.4.x the new keyboard must be manually enabled from settings if it has not been in use before 1.0.4.x.

UPDATE: The VKB continues to work normally after update to 1.1.1.27 "Vaarainj√§rvi" so it is "update proof" (for now). Of course, this may vary in the future updates if the VKB handling in SailfishOS should change.    

TODO: RPM package for easier installation.
